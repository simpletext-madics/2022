## Task 2: What is unclear? Given a passage and a query, rank terms/concepts that are required to be explained for understanding this passage (definitions, context, applications,..).

The goal of this task is to decide which terms (up to 5) require explanation and contextualization to help a reader to understand a complex scientific text – for example, with regard to a query, terms that need to be contextualized (with a definition, example and/or use-case). For each passage, participants should provide a ranked list of difficult terms with corresponding scores on the scale 1-3 (3 to be the most difficult terms, while the meaning of terms scored 1 can be dervied or guessed) and on the scale 1-5 (5 to be the most difficult terms). Passages (sentences) are considered to be independent, i.e. difficult term repitition is allowed. Term pooling and automatic metrics (accuracy of term binary classification, NDCG for term ranking, kappa statistics...) will be used to evaluate these results.

*Intput format:* 
* *snt_id*: a unique passage (sentence) identifier
* *source_snt*: passage texte
* *doc_id*: a unique source document identifier
* *query_id*: a query ID
* *query_text*: difficult terms should be extracted from sentences with regard to this query

*Output format:*  

List of terms to be contextualized in a **JSON format** or a tabulated file TSV (for manual runs) with the following fields:
* *run_id*: Run ID starting with **team_id_**
* *manual*: Whether the run is manual {0,1}
* *snt_id*: a unique passage (sentence) identifier from the input file 
* *term*: Term or other phrase to be explained
* *term_rank_snt*: term difficulty rank within the given sentence
* *score_5*: term difficulty score on the scale from 1 to 5 (5 to be the most difficult terms)
* *score_3*: term difficulty score on the scale from 1 to 3 (3 to be the most difficult terms)

### Evaluation
Term pooling and automatic metrics (NDCG,...) will be used to evaluate these results.

OUTPUT example:

| run_id | manual | topic_id | passage_text | term | rank |
|:-------|:-------|:---------|:-------------|:-----|:-----|
| ST_1 | 1 | 1 | Automated decision making based on big data and machine learning (ML) algorithms can result in discriminatory decisions against certain protected groups defined upon personal data like gender, race, sexual orientation etc. Such algorithms designed to discover patterns in big data might not only pick up any encoded societal biases in the training data, but even worse, they might reinforce such biases resulting in more severe discrimination. The majority of thus far proposed fairness-aware machine learning approaches focus solely on the pre-, in- or post-processing steps of the machine learning process, that is, input data, learning algorithms or derived models, respectively. However, the fairness problem cannot be isolated to a single step of the ML process. Rather, discrimination is often a result of complex interactions between big data and algorithms, and therefore, a more holistic approach is required. The proposed FAE (Fairness-Aware Ensemble) framework combines fairness-related interventions at both pre- and postprocessing steps of the data analysis process. In the preprocessing step, we tackle the problems of under-representation of the protected group (group imbalance) and of class-imbalance by generating balanced training samples. In the post-processing step, we tackle the problem of class overlapping by shifting the decision boundary in the direction of fairness.| machine learning | 1 |
